# Petri Dish Simulation

## Usage
Run the main class in a [Processing](https://processing.org/) IDE. There will be a series of "molecules" bouncing about. The speed and number of molecules can be changed using the provided buttons.
The simulation can also be paused, played and reset at any point. The state of the simulation is saved every time the simulation is closed and recreated upon opening.

Molecule bouncing trajectories are computed using a vector approach and object collisions are detected using a look-ahead algorithm.
