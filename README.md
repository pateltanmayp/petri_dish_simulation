# Petri Dish Simulation

## Usage
Run the main class in a [Processing](https://processing.org/) IDE. You will see a series of "molecules" bouncing about. You can change their speed and number by using the provided buttons.
You can also play, pause and reset the simulation. The state of the simulation is saved every time the simulation is closed and recreated upon opening.

Molecule bouncing trajectories are computed using a vector approach and object collisions are detected using a look-ahead algorithm.
